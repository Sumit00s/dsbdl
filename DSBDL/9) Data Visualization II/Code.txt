9) Data Visualization II
1. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic' as used in the above problem. Plot a box plot for
distribution of age with respect to each gender along with the information about whether
they survived or not. (Column names : 'sex' and 'age')
2. Write observations on the inference from the above statistics.




import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the Titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# Drop rows with missing 'age' values
df.dropna(subset=['age'], inplace=True)

# Box plot: distribution of age by gender and survival status
sns.boxplot(x='sex', y='age', hue='survived', data=df)

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Age Distribution by Gender and Survival Status')
plt.xlabel('Gender')
plt.ylabel('Age')

# Display the plot
plt.show()




✍️ Observations and Inferences:
Age Distribution:

Both males and females show a wide range of ages (from infants to 70+ years).

Survival Pattern for Females:

Most females, across all ages, have a higher survival rate.

The median age of surviving females is slightly lower than that of non-surviving females.

Survival Pattern for Males:

Males had a lower survival rate compared to females.

Surviving males tend to be younger on average compared to non-surviving males.

Many young males (kids and teenagers) survived.

Outliers:

There are older survivors (above 60 years), but they are very few in number.

General Pattern:

The famous "Women and Children First" policy seems reflected here:
Females and younger passengers had better chances of survival.
